    Symptoms

*No symptoms in most people.* Most people  (8 out of 10) infected with
West Nile virus do not develop any symptoms.

*Febrile illness (fever) in some people.* About 1 in 5 people who are
infected develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body
aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people with this
type of West Nile virus disease recover completely, but fatigue and
weakness can last for weeks or months.

*Serious symptoms in a few people. *About 1 in 150 people who are
infected develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system
such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis
(inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord).

  * Symptoms of severe illness include high fever, headache, neck
    stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions,
    muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis.
  * Severe illness can occur in people of any age; however, people over
    60 years of age are at greater risk. People with certain medical
    conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease,
    and people who have received organ transplants, are also at greater
    risk.
  * Recovery from severe illness might take several weeks or months.
    Some effects to the central nervous system might be permanent.
  * About 1 out of 10  people who develop severe illness affecting the
    central nervous system die.


    Diagnosis

  * See your healthcare provider if you develop the symptoms described
    above.
  * Your healthcare provider can order tests to look for West Nile virus
    infection.
  * To learn more about testing, visit our Healthcare Providers
    page(https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/healthcareproviders/healthCareProviders-Diagnostic.html)
    <https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/healthcareproviders/healthCareProviders-Diagnostic.html>.


    Treatment

  * No vaccine or specific antiviral treatments for West Nile virus
    infection are available.
  * Over-the-counter pain relievers can be used to reduce fever and
    relieve some symptoms
  * In severe cases, patients often need to be hospitalized to receive
    supportive treatment, such as intravenous fluids, pain medication,
    and nursing care.
  * If you think you or a family member might have West Nile virus
    disease, talk with your health care provider.
